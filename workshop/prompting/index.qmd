## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) can greatly enhance education by providing explanations, examples, and instant feedback. Employing effective prompting techniques is critical, however. This affects whether LLMs support meaningful learning or potentially allow students to bypass learning altogether. Thoughtfully constructed prompts use principles from cognitive science, promoting active student engagement and deeper understanding.

## Key Principles for Educational Prompting

### 1. Retrieval Practice
Encourage recall of learned information to strengthen memory.

::: {.tutor-example}
Quiz me on three key points from our organic chemistry lecture on reaction kinetics.
:::

### 2. Scaffolding
Break complex tasks into smaller steps to guide students gradually.

::: {.tutor-example}
First, give the balanced equation for this [chemical] reaction. Now, what are the initial concentrations?
:::

### 3. Metacognition
Promote self-reflection and justification of reasoning.

::: {.tutor-example}
Explain why you chose this method for determining equilibrium. Are there assumptions you've made?
:::

### 4. Cognitive Load Management
Chunk information clearly to prevent overload.

::: {.tutor-example}
Define entropy briefly. Next, explain how entropy differs from enthalpy.
:::


## Effective Prompting Techniques

### Set Clear Roles and Contexts
Provide explicit roles to guide the LLM's responses.

::: {.prompt-example}
You are an organic chemistry tutor helping a first-year student.
:::

### Specify Tasks and Formats Clearly
Be specific to ensure precise responses.

::: {.prompt-example}
Explain ionic bonding using a real-world analogy suitable for freshmen.
:::

### Use Examples or Templates
Demonstrate the desired output.

::: {.prompt-example}
Provide a solution formatted as follows: First state the concept, then illustrate with a concrete chemistry example.
:::


### Chain-of-Thought and Reasoning
Ask the LLM to detail its reasoning or provide multiple approaches.

::: {.prompt-example}
Step-by-step, explain how to identify the limiting reagent in this reaction.
:::

:::{.callout-tip appearance="default"}
## ✅
Instruct the LLM to think first: "Explain your reasoning first, then state the answer."
:::

:::{.callout-warning appearance="default"}
## ❌
Instruct the LLM to give the answer first: "State the answer first, then explain your reasoning."
:::



### Iterative Refinement
Treat prompting as an interactive process, refining outputs through conversation.

::: {.prompt-example}
Simplify the previous explanation and provide a metaphor.
:::


### Use Markdown Formatting
Use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) formatting to make the prompt more readable (e.g. lists, bold, italics, etc.).

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Basic Markdown Formatting
```markdown
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3

**Bold text**

*Italic text*

1. List item 1
2. List item 2
3. List item 3
```

Use delimiters (e.g. `---`, `"""`) to indicate different roles or parts of a prompt.

::: 

## Example Teaching Activities

### Illustrative Analogies

::: {.prompt-example}
Create an everyday analogy to illustrate Le Châtelier’s principle.
:::

### Practice Questions Generation

::: {.prompt-example}
Create three practice questions on acid-base titrations at varying difficulty levels.
:::

:::{.callout-warning}
Note that the task of generating practice questions is a complex task that requires a good understanding of the topic. It will be necessary to provide the LLM with a template for the questions, and to provide examples of how to format the questions. Additionally, you will need to consider how to define task difficulty very carefully.
:::


### Lesson Planning

::: {.prompt-example}
Outline a 50-minute lesson plan on the ideal gas law with an interactive demonstration.
:::


### Interactive Problem Solving

::: {.prompt-example}
Guide me through solving a galvanic cell problem, providing hints without revealing the solution immediately.
:::


## Example Student Activities

### Clarifying Concepts

::: {.prompt-example}
Simplify and explain the concept of electrons behaving as waves.
:::

### Creating Study Guides

::: {.prompt-example}
Summarize thermodynamics laws and generate two review questions for each.
:::

### Self-Explanation and Reflection

::: {.prompt-example}
Evaluate my explanation of buffer solutions and ask a clarifying follow-up question.
:::

### Error-Checking Practice

::: {.prompt-example}
Review my solution to this equilibrium problem, identify mistakes, and guide me in correcting them.
:::

### Brainstorming Project Ideas

::: {.prompt-example}
Suggest three practical applications of electrochemistry suitable for a student project.
